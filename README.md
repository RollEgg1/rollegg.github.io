My Github account is a platform where I showcase my projects related to website development, programming, and other related endeavors. It serves as a repository for my code and allows me to collaborate with other developers, share my work with the community, and receive feedback. Through my Github account, I demonstrate my skills in various programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more.
The repository I created is a portfolio website, designed to showcase a collection of projects, skills, and achievements of an individual or organization in the field of information technology.
I opened up GitHub Desktop on my computer. I entered my GitHub username and password to log into my account. I searched for the repository I wanted to clone and selected it from the list. In the repository details view, I clicked on the "Code" button. From the drop-down menu, I chose the option "Open with GitHub Desktop." GitHub Desktop prompted me to choose a location on my computer where I wanted to save the repository. I browsed through my directories and selected the desired folder as the save location. I confirmed my choice by clicking on the "Choose" or "Open" button. GitHub Desktop started the cloning process, and I could see the progress of the cloning in the application's interface. Once the cloning process was completed, I received a notification or confirmation message from GitHub Desktop. I opened up my preferred code editor or IDE, and within it, I navigated to the folder where the repository was cloned. I could now start working with the files from the cloned repository on my local machine.
